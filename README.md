  :wave: :wave: Welcome to the Amazon Bedrock Agent Samples repository :wave: :wave:
</p>

This repository provides examples and best practices for working with [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/). 

Amazon Bedrock Agents enables you to automate complex workflows, build robust and scalable end-to-end solutions from experimentation to production and quickly adapt to new models and experiments.

With the [multi-agent collaboration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-multi-agents-collaboration.html) feature you can plan and execute complex tasks across different agents using the supervisor collaboration mode. As well as have an unified conversation across agents with built-in intent classification using the supervisor with routing collaboration mode and fallback to the supervisor mode when an intention cannot be detected. Amazon Bedrock Agents will provide you with traces to observe your agents behavior across multi-agent flows and with the guardrails, security and privacy that are standard across Amazon Bedrock features.

## Overview

Amazon Bedrock Agents enables you to create AI-powered assistants that can perform complex tasks and interact with various APIs and services. 

This repository provides practical examples to help you understand and implement agentic solutions.

The solutions presented here use the [boto3 SDK in Python](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agent.html), however, you can create Bedrock Agents solutions using any of the AWS SDKs for [C++](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/cpp/api/LATEST/aws-cpp-sdk-bedrock-agent/html/annotated.html), [Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/bedrockagent/), [Java](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/bedrockagent/package-summary.html), [JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/client/bedrock-agent/), [Kotlin](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/kotlin/api/latest/bedrockagent/index.html), [.NET](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/v3/apidocs/items/BedrockAgent/NBedrockAgent.html), [PHP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/namespace-Aws.BedrockAgent.html), [Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/BedrockAgent.html), [Rust](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-bedrockagent/latest/aws_sdk_bedrockagent/), [SAP ABAP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-sap-abap/v1/api/latest/bdr/index.html) or [Swift](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/swift/api/awsbedrockruntime/0.34.0/documentation/awsbedrockruntime)

- [examples/amazon-bedrock-agent/](/examples/amazon-bedrock-agent/): Shows Amazon Bedrock Agents examples.

- [examples/amazon-bedrock-multi-agent-collaboration/](/examples/amazon-bedrock-multi-agent-collaboration/): Shows Amazon Bedrock Multi-agent collaboration examples.

- [src/shared](/src/shared/): This module consists of shared tools that connect to Amazon Bedrock Agents via Action Groups. They provide functionality like [Web Search](/src/shared/file_store/), [Working Memory](/src/shared/working_memory/), and [Stock Data Lookup](/src/shared/stock_data/).

- [src/utils](/src/utils/): This module contains utilities for building and using various Amazon Bedrock features, providing a higher level of abstraction than the underlying APIs.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to [`src/`](/src/) for more details.
2. To get started, navigate to the example you want to deploy in the [`examples/*`](/examples/) directory. 
3. Follow the deployment steps in the `examples/*/*/README.md` file of the example.
