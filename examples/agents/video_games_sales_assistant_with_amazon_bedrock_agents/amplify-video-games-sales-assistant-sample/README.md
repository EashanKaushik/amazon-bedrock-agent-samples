# Getting Started with Amplify Video Games Sales Assistant

This tutorial guides you through the process of setting up a React front-end application using AWS Amplify that integrates with an Amazon Bedrock Agent project. The services to be deployed are: Amplify Hosting, and it leverages Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional web application that allows users to interact with a conversational AI agent for video game sales assistance.

> IMPORTANT: This example is meant for demo purposes and is not production ready. Please make sure to validate the code with your organizations security best practices.

## Prerequisites

- An **Alias** created from your **Amazon Bedrock Agent** that you created in the first tutorial.
- [Node.js > 18 version required](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [Install the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen1/react/tools/cli/start/set-up-cli/) with the following command:

``` bash
