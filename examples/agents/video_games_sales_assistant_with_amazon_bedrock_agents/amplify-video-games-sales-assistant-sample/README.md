# Getting Started with Amplify Video Games Sales Assistant

This tutorial guides you through the process of setting up a React front-end application using AWS Amplify that integrates with an Amazon Bedrock Agent project. The services to be deployed are: Amplify Hosting, and it leverages Amazon IAM user credentials service authorization from the front-end application.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional web application that allows a guest user to interact with a conversational AI agent for video game sales assistance.

> IMPORTANT: This sample application is meant for demo purposes and is not production ready. Please make sure to validate the code with your organizations security best practices.

> IMPORTANT: Clean up resources after you test the demo to avoid unnecessary costs. Follow the clean-up steps provided.

## Prerequisites

- An **Alias** created from your **Amazon Bedrock Agent** that you created in the first tutorial.
- [Node.js > 18 version required](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [Install the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen1/react/tools/cli/start/set-up-cli/) with the following command:

``` bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli 
```

## Amplify Deployment

Run the following commands in the React front-end application.

### Install React Application Dependencies

``` bash
npm install
```

### Initialize the Amplify Application using **Gen1**

``` bash
amplify init
```

- To initialize the project use the **suggested configuration**.
- Select your authentication method.

### Create an IAM User Access Keys for your Front-end Application

[Create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) and [create Access key and Secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/create.keypair.html) for programmatic access to your front-end application.

In the **Permissions policies** section of you user, click **Add permissions** and then click **Create inline policy** to add the following inline policy using the **JSON Policy editor**, update the values with your **<agent_arn>**, **<agent_id>**, **<account_id>** and **<question_answers_table_arn>** that you can find in the outputs from the SAM tutorial.

``` json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "InvokeBedrockAgent",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeAgent"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "<agent_arn>",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:*:<account_id>:agent-alias/<agent_id>/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "InvokeBedrockModel",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeModel"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:*:<account_id>:inference-profile/us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDB",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:Query"
            ],
            "Resource": "<question_answers_table_arn>"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Configure the Environment Variables for the Front-end Application

Programmatic credentials and AWS region used for your deployment:
- **ACCESS_KEY_ID**

- **AGENT_ID**
- **AGENT_ALIAS_ID**
- **QUESTION_ANSWERS_TABLE_NAME** 

### Add Hosting and Testing

``` bash
amplify add hosting
```

### Testing your Data Analyst Assistant Generative AI Application

Now you can test the Data Analyst Assistant with the following sample questions:

- Hello
- How can you help me?
- What is the structure of the data?
- Which developers tend to get the best reviews?
- What were the total sales for each region between 2000 and 2010? Give me the data in percentages.
- What were the best-selling games in the last 10 years?
- What are the best-selling video game genres?
- Give me the top 3 game publishers.
- Give me the top 3 video games with the best reviews and the best sales.

## Cleaning-up Resources (optional)

The next step is optional to delete the resources that we've created.

``` bash
amplify delete
```

Do not forget to [remove your IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_remove.html) and Access keys for your front-end application.
